### focus on user outcomes 

1. people expect every new experience to be better than the last;
2. our products and service are measured on the experience that they deliver;

==> important to understand what people need and what they expect .

> 1. Do you know your user ?
> 2. Do you understand their needs ?
> 3. Can you meet those needs through your work ?

### Restless reinvention

active and striving to improve by whatever means are available to us.

### Diverse empowered teams

1. How am i going to build diversity into my teams ?
2. How am i going to empower my teams ?

## The Loop

### Observe 

1. Getting to kown your user
2. The purpose of Design research (really vaild information)


> Make it a habit to challenge your assumptions. Here are some key moments when you should do so:
> * During project kickoffs
> * After reading a requirements document or scope of work (SOW)
> * After reading a request for proposal (RFP) or change request


> —— Do matters for real people


Check out the [ IBM Design Research](https://www.ibm.com/design/research/) practice to see how you can get your whole team involved in the design research process, regardless of background or role.

### Reflect

#### asking why

> asking why should be the first thing that comes to your mind and the last thing that comes to mind , because if you don't do that you're missing all these opportunities to be better that you could have been just with your own skills .
> 
> for example :
> What problem do your users have today? 
> ----- My kids won’t eat the healthy breakfast I make for them, and therefore aren’t getting enough energy to start the day.
> Why might that be?
> ----- Because they eat sugary cereal at their friend’s house and only want that for breakfast.
> Why?
> ----- Because it tastes really good and that’s all that matters to them.
> Why?
> ----- Because they cannot make an informed decision about taste vs. healthy benefits.
> Why?
> ----- Because they don’t understand the importance of nutrition.

#### problem statement

1. observe:Problem statements should always include a user and their current problem, not yours.
2. reflect:Problem statements should be flexible and iterative as you learn more about your users and their current state.
3. make:Problem statements should be written collaboratively, with all members of a team who have relevant expertise.

##### how to create a greate problem statement

1. find your user
2. whats their problem and how to solve
3. why?
4. loop

> problem statements reframe with the user in mind 
> they are meant to change and be flexible
> hold off on solutioning 

##### Best Practices for Alignment

1. EveryOne has a voice (eg. sharpis and post-it notes , digital tool)
2. Keep people on track (visible)
3. Get a sense of room (vote)
4. document your decisions 
5. End with a summary

===> how to start?

> 1. start small
> 2. keep it simple
> 3. try something

### Make

#### big idea

##### Features & Functions
1. predictable solutions
2. pigeon holed thinking
3. leaving the user behind

##### diverge
###### Less talking, more writing.
1. Focused conversations: You will spend less time talking in circles, so you can make decisions faster.
2. Documentation: You will have evidence to support your decision making, and ideas won’t get lost in the chaos.
3. Unique perspectives: Everyone will be able to share their ideas and opinions quickly.

###### Less writing, more drawing.
1. Illustrate the experience: Provide an idea of what the experience could look like and, more importantly, feel like for the user.
2. Drawing is accessible: Drawing cuts through the barriers that language, various disciplines, and technical expertise create.
3. Clear and direct: There is less room for interpretation with drawing, allowing conversations to be more focused.
